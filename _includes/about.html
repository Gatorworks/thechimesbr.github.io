        <p>
            The Chimes Restaurant & Tap Room has been a Baton Rouge and LSU tradition serving fine patrons for over 25 years.  We have continued to grow and have brought this tradition to our second location in Baton Rouge and now a third, located in Covington.  Our goal is to provide a relaxed, family friendly experience while serving the best made-from-scratch menu possible.  We take pride in having one of the most extensive beer and liquor selections available.  Thank you for your continued support, we look forward to seeing you soon.
